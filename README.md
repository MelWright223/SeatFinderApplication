This is the Read.me for the Seat Finder Project for COMP3000. 
This repository contains the source code for three elements for the project, this includes the following - 
API, Mobile application and a website. 
These elements will make up the foundation of the mobile seat finder application.

The aspects of this project is to help people find their booked seats on transport, E.G. trains and planes, using Augmented Reality. As over 200,000 people use the trains in the South-West of England alone, this application will help both passengers and train staff. Due to some of the train journeys not including a reservation system, the mobile application will use a Artificial Intelligent(AI) scanner to detect if people are in seats and show any seats within the carriage the user is currently in. 
With this in mind, this feature will help train managers manage how any people are on the train, without the worry of over-crowding and people missing trains because of it.
